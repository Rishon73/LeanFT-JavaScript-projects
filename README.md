# LeanFT-JavaScript-projects


For every LeanFT JavaScript, we need to install the LeanFT JavaScript SDK in the testing project folder (this is done once):

* **Windows** _\<LeanFT installation folder\>\SDK\JavaScript\js_installation.bat ._
* **Linux / Mac** _\<LeanFT installation folder\>/sdk/JavaScript/js_installation.sh ._
