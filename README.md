# LeanFT-JavaScript-projects


For every LeanFT JavaScript, we need to install the LeanFT JavaScript SDK in the testing project folder (this is done once):

* **Windows _\<LeanFT installation folder\>\SDK\JavaScript\js_installation.bat ._**
* **Linux / Mac _\<LeanFT installation folder\>/sdk/JavaScript/js_installation.sh ._**
  
  
**Note:** The trailing . (dot) are part of the command, inicating, obviously "this folder".
